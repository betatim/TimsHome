Title: Communicating in writing

slug: communicating-in-writing

We humans communicate a lot. Increasingly so in writing. This post is exists
because I am trying to find books, guides, courses, lessons and expert advice
on how to get better at communicating, in writing.

I am looking for ways to improve my (and others) communication in the context
of chats, forums, emails, issues and other situations where we communicate
asynchronously and iteratively.

See, a lot of people read "Looking for help communicating in writing" and their
mind instantly goes to something like [The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) or similar guides on grammar and style. However these
guides are aimed at writing where there is no iteration. For example newspaper
articles, scientific papers, and newsletters. When writing these I communicate
but I do not really expect a back and forth with some (or all) of the readers
to start.

The kind of "communicating in writing" that I have in mind is when you expect
that the person receiving your communication will reply and that you will reply
to their reply. Maybe at some point a third person will join. And then you
drop off. There are several iterations to the whole thing and who takes part
changes over time. You might even call it a "conversation".

This kind of conversation is different from what the "Elements of Style"
authors had in mind. It is also different from a conversation where we use our
voices and see each other. This is why I think this is a unique kind of
communication and as a result there are different tricks of the trade, bits
of advice and points to consider.

What are your favourite resources and ways to get better at this particular
"written conversation" style of communication? Have you taken a course that
is great? Read a guide?

This post started because I realised that [it didn't fit in a tweet](https://twitter.com/betatim/status/1460555945545809922), but that tweet got some good replies already! Post more
there if you know other resources.
