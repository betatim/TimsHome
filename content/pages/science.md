title: Science

Have you noticed that the universe is full of matter and surprisingly
little antimatter? Why this is so is one of the main questions the
scientists of the [LHCb experiment][lhcb] hope to answer. I am one of
them.

I am interested in applying machine-learning to particle physics. In
particular tree based methods, bayesian optimisation and transfer
learning.

I work for [Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne][EPFL] as post-doc, previously
I worked for [CERN][] as a research fellow. Along side my research, I
lead the team developing the simulation and reconstruction software
for one of the experiment's detectors. Without our from first principles
simulation we could not do any of our data analyses!
I also think
about how we can record as much data as possible by making use of
modern machine learning techniques.

Before coming to CERN I was a particle physics graduate student with
[The University of Manchester][man]. My research focused on properties
of [top quarks][topquark] using the vast data set from the [D0
detector][d0] at Fermilab's [Tevatron][tev] near Chicago. I defended
my thesis in December 2012

##Publications

Here is a list of my top publications and other science related
documents. My PhD thesis is linked to at the bottom as well. Take a look at the
[full list of my publications][inspire] on INSPIRE.

###LHCb VELO Upgrade Technical Design Report

[PDF][velotdr]

I am the team leader for the simulation and reconstruction software project
and was responsible for the Module layout and Performance chapters of the report.

###Measurement of Leptonic Asymmetries and Top Quark Polarization in tt̅ Production

[Phys.Rev. D87 (2013) 011103][afb]

I performed the whole analysis: writing the code to select events,
compare simulation to data and perform the statistical
analysis. Wrote the final paper and shepherded the paper through
internal collaboration review.

###Measurement of spin correlation in tt̅ production using dilepton final states

[Phys.Lett. B702 (2011) 16-23][spin]

I wrote the code to select events, compare simulation to data and
perform the statistical analysis, edited the paper and shepherded the
paper through internal collaboration and journal review.
 
###Measurement of spin correlation in tt̅ production using a matrix element approach

[Phys.Rev.Lett. 107 (2011) 032001][spinmatrix]

I prepared the data and Monte Carlo samples, planned analysis
strategies and lead discussions with theorists. Created the final
figures used in the paper.


###Evidence for spin correlation in tt̅ production

[Phys.Rev.Lett. 108 (2012) 032004][spincombo]

I took part in planning and discussions in our four person team on
extending our previous analysis to this new final state, lead
interactions with theorists. I created the final figures used in the
paper.


###A measurement of the WZ and ZZ production cross sections using leptonic final states in 8.6 fb<sup>-1</sup> of pp̅ collisions

[arXiv:1201.5652][wzzz]

This analysis uses a multivariate classifier to identify electrons
which I proposed and implemented, with efficiency gains of ~10% per
electron over previous algorithms. These are the most precise WZ and
ZZ cross section measurements at sqrt(s)=1.96TeV to date.

###Thesis: Top Quark Spin Correlations and Leptonic Forward-Backward Asymmetries at D0

[inspire entry][thesis]

A summary of all my work as a PhD student, my thesis. Only print it
off if you need a door stop, otherwise read it on your screen.
