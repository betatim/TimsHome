I am an experimental physicist working at [CERN][cern], doing science with
data. Other things I am crazy about: python, machine learning,
statistics and triathlons.

I am a member of the [LHCb collaboration][lhcb] which is based at CERN. I work
on designing the detector upgrade, pattern recognition software as
well as the software trigger. The trigger decides what data to record
using features engineered by the pattern recognition. It will be
sifting through an astounding 3TB/s of data in real time!

I have experience as a scientist who writes a lot of software, leading international teams
composed of experts from different fields, statistics, data science,
machine learning and all the things you associate with a "scientific
approach" to solving complex problems. I am a big fan of building a
minimally viable solution to a problem and then iterating on it. In my
spare time I like to train for and compete in triathlons.

Since September 2014 I have been working for [EPFL][epfl] as a post
doctoral researcher. I am based at CERN, the home of hte Large Hadron
Collider. My previous two years were spent working directly for
[CERN][cern] as a research fellow.

I love to code in [Python][py], but am OK with writing C++ (mostly
for work). Look at some of my projects on: [bitbucket][c] and
[github][g]. I like to use data, simulations and statistics to find
things out.

In my spare time I like to train for and compete in
[triathlons][tri]. This involves swimming, biking and running crazy
long distances without a break. The aim is to complete all three
sports (including transitions!) in the fastest time possible. I enjoy
the challenge of planning and training as well as juggling live and
work during the months before the race. Race day is a physical and
mental challenge as you race against the clock and your expectations
for several hours.
