![Tim Head](/images/tim.jpeg "Tim Head")

I joined [CERN][cern] as a research fellow in October 2012. I
currently work on the [LHCb experiment][lhcb] which is based at
CERN. Here I lead the team working on the reconstruction and
simulation software for the upgrade [Vertex Locator][velo] (VELO). I
also work on designing and implementing an outrageously ambitious
trigger system for LHCb.

My favourite programming language is [Python][py]. I also write a lot
of C++. Look at some of my projects on: [bitbucket][c] and [github][g].

I love the sport of [triathlon][tri]. It involves swimming, biking and
running in immediate succession. The aim is to complete all three
(including transitions!) in the fastest time possible.

Currently I live near Geneva, Switzerland. I've also lived in:

* Manchester, England
* Chicago, USA
* Frankfurt, Germany
