Handling unforeseen and unsolved challenges on a daily basis. I lead the
[Binder Project](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html) and
work at [Skribble](https://skribble.com) as a senior software engineer. In
my free time I swim, bike, run.

## History

In the autumn of 2018 I joined [Skribble](https://skribble.com) as a senior
software engineer. I continue to offer [JupyterHub consulting][wtt] through
Wild Tree Tech.

In May 2016 I started <a href="https://www.wildtreetech.com">Wild Tree Tech</a> a
Switzerland based engineering company that builds, maintains and operates
[JupyterHubs](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
[BinderHubs](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub) for teachers,
data-science teams and the community.

Previously I was an experimental physicist working at [CERN][cern],
doing science with data.

I have a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics from [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

Things I have done:

* Created [Project Everware][everware] which allows users to edit and run
  other people's code with one click, even if that code has
  complicated setup instructions. This project has morphed into [mybinder.org][binder]
  which serves over 100000 sessions a week to the general public. I continue to
  lead the project.

* Conceived, designed and developed a four day training program for
  young scientists: [the LHCb Starterkit][starter]. It covers basic
  tools such as bash, git, and python (based on SWC material) as well
  as the LHCb data-analysis framework. The first event had 40 participants.
  It is now the default training course of the collaboration.

* Founded Social Solutions Research, a not-for-profit association
  dedicated to applying technology and innovation to humanitarian
  problems. I lead a team of five, we were contracted by the
  International Committee of the Red Cross to develop a [better body
  bag][cdsbbb] for mass-casualty situations. We received over CHF100'000
  of grant funding to further develop the bag. [Read more][bbb].

* I got my start in open-source projects by contributing code,
  filing bugs and reviewing code focused on tree based
  machine-learning methods for the open-source [scikit-learn][sklearn]
  project.

Tim is on [Twitter][], and he sometimes posts pretty things to [Instagram][].


## Free time

In my spare time I like to train for and compete in
[triathlons][tri]. This involves swimming, biking and running crazy
long distances without a break. The aim is to complete all three
sports (including transitions!) in the fastest time possible. I enjoy
the challenge of planning and executing my training as well as juggling life and
work during the months before a race. Race day is a physical and
mental challenge as you race against the clock and your expectations
for several hours.
