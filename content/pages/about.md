I am an experimental physicist working at [CERN][cern], doing science with
data. Other things I am crazy about: python, machine learning,
statistics and triathlons.

I have a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics plus three years post
doctoral experience at [CERN][cern].  During this time I have
contributed to [open-source software][g], conceived, designed and
developed a [four day training program for young scientists][starter],
created a project to encourage [reproducible science][everware], lead
teams, and developed a [better body bag][cdsbbb] for the [ICRC][icrc].

Things I have done:

* Created [Project Everware][everware] which allows users to edit and run
  other people's code with one click, even if that code has a
  complicated setup or environment. The aim of the project is to
  encourage reusable and reproducible science. Presented it at [MozFest 2015][mf15].
  Considered for the LHCb experiment's data analysis
  preservation effort.

* Conceived, designed and developed a four day training program for
  young scientists: [the LHCb Starterkit][starter]. It covers basic
  tools such as bash, git, and python (based on SWC material) as well
  as the LHCb data-analysis framework. Two successful events so far
  each with 40 participants. It is now the default training course of
  the collaboration.

* Founded Social Solutions Research, a not-for-profit association
  dedicated to applying technology and innovation to humanitarian
  problems. As a team of five, we are currently contracted by the
  International Committee of the Red Cross to develop a [better body
  bag][cdsbbb] for mass-casualty situations.

* lead two geographically distributed teams developing the simulation
  and pattern recognition software of two sub-detectors of the LHCb
  experiment to evaluate the performance and inform the design for the
  upgrade of the experiment.

* Contributed code, filed bugs and reviewed code focused on tree based
  machine-learning methods for the open-source [scikit-learn][sklearn]
  project.


## Consulting

I am passionate about bringing data analysis skills to a broad
audience. I have experience with machine learning, data science, and
project management. I offer consulting and training services to
companies, institutions, individuals, and researchers -- feel free to
contact with new opportunities.


## Contact

If you want to get in touch, send [an email](mailto:betatim@gmail.com).

Tim is on [Twitter][], and he sometimes posts pretty things to [Instagram][].


## Free time

In my spare time I like to train for and compete in
[triathlons][tri]. This involves swimming, biking and running crazy
long distances without a break. The aim is to complete all three
sports (including transitions!) in the fastest time possible. I enjoy
the challenge of planning and training as well as juggling live and
work during the months before the race. Race day is a physical and
mental challenge as you race against the clock and your expectations
for several hours.
