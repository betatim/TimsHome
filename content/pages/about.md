An experimental physicist working at [CERN][cern], doing
science with data. Also: python, statistics and triathlons.

He is a member of the [LHCb collaboration][lhcb] which is based at
CERN. He works on designing the detector upgrade, pattern recognition
software as well as the software trigger (processing 4TB/s of data in
real time).

He has experience as a software engineer, leading international teams
composed of experts from different fields, statistics, data science,
machine learning and all the things you associate with a "scientific
approach" to solving complex problems. He is a big fan of building a
minimally viable solution to problem and then iterating on it. In his
spare time he likes to train for and compete in triathlons.

Tim has been working for [EPFL][epfl] as a post doctoral researcher
since September 2014. He spent the previous two years working for
[CERN][cern] as a research fellow.

He loves to code in [Python][py], but is OK with writing C++ (mostly
for work). Look at some of his projects on: [bitbucket][c] and
[github][g]. He likes to use data, simulations and statistics to find
things out.

In his spare time he likes to train for and compete in
[triathlons][tri]. This involves swimming, biking and running crazy
long distances without a break. The aim is to complete all three
sports (including transitions!) in the fastest time possible.
