{% img /images/tim.jpeg 200 200 "Tim Head" "Tim Head" %}

Tim joined [CERN][cern] as a research fellow in October 2012. He
currently works on the [LHCb experiment][lhcb] which is based at
CERN. He leads the team working on the reconstruction and simulation
software for the upgrade [Vertex Locator][velo] (VELO). He is also
designing and implementing an outrageously ambitious trigger system
for LHCb.

He loves to code in [Python][py], but is OK with writing C++ (mostly
for work). Look at some of his projects on: [bitbucket][c] and
[github][g]. He likes to use data, simulations and statistics to find
things out.

In his spare time he likes to train for and compete in
[triathlons][tri]. This involves swimming, biking and running crazy
long distances without a break. The aim is to complete all three
sports (including transitions!) in the fastest time possible.
