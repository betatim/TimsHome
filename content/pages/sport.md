Title: Sports
status: hidden

[Triathlon][tri]: swimming, biking and running crazy long distances
without a break.  The aim is to complete all three sports (including
transitions!) in the fastest time possible.

In 2015 I ran more than 1000miles and spent over seven days cycling!

In May 2013 I took part in the [Geneva half-marathon][genevahalf], a
few weeks later I finished the [Cyclotour du leman][cyclotour], a
180km bike race. It was my first "century ride" (a bike ride of more
than 100miles). In August I did my best not to melt in the heat at [La
cyclosportive des vins du valais][vinduvalais], a shorter race but
with a lot more climbing.

In 2012 I competed in a 5km lake swim at [Utterly Buttermere][utterly]
and my first [half Ironman distance triathlon][halfim] which I
completed in just over five hours.

Previously I have taken part in the 2011 [Chicago triathlon][chitri],
the 2011 [Big Shoulders][bigshoulders] lake swim, several sprint
distance triathlons ([Fermilab][fermitri] 2010 and 2011, [Blenheim
Palace][blenheimtri] 2012, [Geneva][genevatri] 2013), several 10km and
5km distance running races.
